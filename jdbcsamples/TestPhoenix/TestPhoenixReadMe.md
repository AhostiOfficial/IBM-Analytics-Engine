**Overview**
- This is just a simple jdbc program to show how the phoenix endpoints work.
- To run this sample, you need to have an IAE Cluster up and running. 
- Note down the endpoints from the VCAP of your service instance.
- Change the java program to use these endpoints
- You also need phoenix 4.9 client Java libraries. These are shipped with the project for now.
